# HTML Landing Page.
This repo has a mini project I did to create a landing page the displays every time I start my browser. It displays a background image (all downloaded from prexels.com), the current time which constantly updates, a greeting and a message. The backgound image and the heading colors are randomized between 7 different packages.

#This repo contains the following folders and files
- index.html
- app.js
- object.js
- style.css
- img folder

## index.html
This is the html code for the file. It has a `<header>` tag that contains three blank heading tags: an `<h1>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` tag.

## app.js
This is the javascript that controls the changes made the DOM and CSS.

## object.js
This is the javascript that holds the format objects for updating the css each time the browser is loaded or the page is refreshed. The format objects are made up of images and heading colors.

## style.css
Stylesheet for the html doc.

## `img` folder
Folder the holds the images for the background.
