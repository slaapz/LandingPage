# HTML Landing Page.
<<<<<<< HEAD

This repo has a mini project I did to create a landing page the displays every time I start my browser. It displays a background image (all downloaded from pexels.com), the current time which constantly updates, a greeting and a message. The backgound image and the heading colors are randomized between 7 different packages.
